# Change Log

## v1.8.0-v1.8.3 - April/May 2025


### Added
- New function in Updates class that checks for any new updates to the updates object, comparing against the current version installed and outputting the difference between the two if any are found. 
- New function in Updates class that allows you to search for updates via country name
- Added iso3166-updates-export directory which is a dedicated folder with all the files/modules/scripts for exporting all the ISO 3166 updates. Previously they were in a single script that was growing to 1000+ lines
- Added unit test that validates each source URL in updates object
- Added custom updates function to software that allows for a custom update to be appended to a country's list of Updates
- Search functionality within the software that allows you to search for any updates using country/subdivision name or subdivision code
- Incorporated the Python package fake-useragent which is a database of user agents to pass into chromedriver, allows for a larger selection of user agents
- Added additional column conversions to the correct_columns function e.g Publication -> Source, Changes made -> Changes
- Added functionality to main export script as well as main software script where you can exclude data for an input year/list of years
- Added unit tests that test the JSON schema of the updates output
- thefuzz Python package added to pyproject dependencies 
- In packaged software, you can now search for updates based on publication date, via a date range, inclusive, e.g "2011-11-09,2013-01-09", if only one date passed in then all updates from that specific date will be gotten
- Additional parameter for Updates class, user can now input a custom filepath to the updates JSON object
- Added new parameter to the custom_update function in Updates class to not overwrite original object with new changes
- Added a parameter in the export scripts: save_each_iteration. After each iteration of country updates data being exported, the individual country data is exported to JSON/CSV. This was created after experiencing Selenium crashing and the export progress being lost
- Additional utility function to export directory that iterates over updates objects and finds objects that are duplicate or nearly duplicates
- Search endpoint added to API, allowing you to search for specific keywords in update objects
- Added unit test that tests the individual total number of updates per country
- Added use_wiki bool parameter to main export pipeline function allowing user to just export the ISO page data by setting this to False
- Temporary manual updates function for get_script that temporary and manually makes changes to the output because of data source errors
- Added auxiliary function in some test instances that parse the original and corrected dates
- In the search function, if a date is explicitly input as the search term, the date issued column is also added to search space
- Added sort_by_date parameter to date_range function that allows you to sort the output of the function by date, latest first
- Added exclude_match_score parameter to search function which excludes the % match the updates are to the search terms. If not excluded a list of results returned, otherwise a dict is returned
- Added export to XML functionality, unit tests added
- Date range functionality added to export pipeline, allowing user to export updates from a specified date range
- __repr__ function added to iso3166-updates class
- Added patching to several unit test cases, suppressing any print statements that are generated from the module being tested. Patch code only required in one test module as its impact is global
- In software package in date_range function, an additional parameter allows you to sort by date descending or ascending
- Latest version of accompanying API pushed & unit tests added to /tests folder

### Changed
- Class name changed from ISO3166_Updates to Updates
- Changed Edition/Newsletter attribute to Source
- Changed Code/Subdivision attribute to Change
- All alpha country codes are passed through convert_to_alpha function rather than just alpha-3 and numeric, for validation 
- The correct_columns in the get script was rewritten to remove redundancy and ensure consistency
- Export JSON and export CSV functionality now input into the same function with an input parameter er that specifies if its exporting csv or json
- Alpha codes range parameter alpha_codes_from_to changed to alpha_codes_range
- Remarks parsing function refactored to remove redundancy
- Any auxiliary function used in the get scripts moved to outside the functions for reusability and readability 
- Reformatted some of the auxiliary function in parse_updates_data script
- When exporting updates data, if Change attribute empty but Desc of Change not then swap the values such that Change is populated
- In the get script pipeline, the wiki parsing function no longer exports the Corrected Date Issued column, this is dropped before being returned
- The functionality that filters out input year/year ranges etc has been moved to a separate utilities function, rather than being in the parse functions
- For the export functionalities, they have been split up into individual modules/scripts, the unit tests have also been split up into their own test instances 
- Auxiliary function that removed any double spacing from a row/string now updated to remove any instances of multiple spaces in string
- Months function in software, to get the updates over the past number of months, removed in place of the date range function which gets the updates over a specified date range
- Any exported updates with no data, exported as [] instead of {}
- Any instances of findNext in BS4 changed to find_next to avoid deprecation error
- When calling the len() function on an object of the Updates class, it should return the number of individual updates objects not the number of country objects
- Made addition of the remarks data on the ISO pages optional with a parameter, by default they are added
- Functionality to convert date format into YYYY-MM-DD format moved to its own static method function
- Likeness score for search changed from float to an int between 1 and 100
- check-for-updates microservice updated with latest version of code 
- Updated alpha code error messages in software
- In check-for-updates script, if bucket doesn't exist, it is created
- Update api docs to include /country_name

### Fixed
- Errors when running the get_updates script from the cmd line/terminal
- In get script when parsing the wiki page of the country's updates, the Changes section can be wrapped in a "span", "h2" or "h3", code changed to fix any errors with differing elements
- Error when renaming/reformating the column names in the correct_cols function of the get script, reordered them such that they don't override each other
- Error with citations/reference links on the wiki pages not being parsed correctly and just the html selector name being exported
- Typing hints for some functions were incorrect type 
- During testing all exported files should be exported to a folder within tests dir, not within main dir 
- Error when concatenating multiple Changes Section, the rows became out of order in terms of Date Issued column, need to resort after concatenation
- Error with some changes data exporting with "Changes" attribute empty and "Desc of Change" populated, it should be the other way around
- Some column names not being changed in correct_columns function, causing errors downstream in pipeline
- Any functions that accept a year input parameter would accept strings with multiple symbols in them e.g ">2009-2010<>" would be accepted with ">" symbol taking priority, an error is now raised if a similar input
- Error in export function where duplicate updates objects were being exported, they weren't being caught because the "corrected" date made it seem unique but the Change/Desc of change were the same
- In custom_update function in software, multiple duplicates of the new update being added to object
- In exported wiki updates table, newline/breakpoints replaced with full stops
- Better error handing in iso3166-updates module

- Workflow throwing error when linting, bandit and or coverage checks executed on multiple versions
- Dependabot software upgrades
- Small fix to search pattern regex in search functionality
- Incorrect URL in check_for_updates function
- In the date_range function, when the sort_by parameter is set but there is only one output object, the correct object format is returned
- For multiple endpoints, if there was a trailing or leading comma in the input parameter, an error would be returned, this comma is now just removed 
- Several fixes to Dockerfile & scripts in check-for-updates app
- Small fix for issue with double spacing before some data in Change attribute " ." - utils function updated
- Layout fix for check-for-updates function
