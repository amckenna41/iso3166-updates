Introduction
------------
iso3166-updates is a repo that consists of a series of scripts that check for any updates/changes to the ISO3166-1 and ISO3166-2 country codes and naming conventions, as per the ISO3166 newsletter (https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html). The ISO3166 standard by the ISO defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, special areas of geographical interest, and their principal subdivisions [1]. 

The <b>ISO 3166-1</b> icons are those of the names of countries and their subdivisions that can be broken into three sets of country codes:
* ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 â€“ two-letter country codes which are the most widely used of the three, and used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions).
* ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 â€“ three-letter country codes which allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes.
* ISO 3166-1 numeric â€“ three-digit country codes which are identical to those developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division, with the advantage of script (writing system) independence, and hence useful for people or systems using non-Latin scripts.

The <b>ISO 3166-2</b> icons are those of the names of countries and their subdivisions â€“ Part 2: Country subdivision code, defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces, states, departments, regions) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1 [[2]](#references). <br>

Problem Statement
-----------------
The ISO is a very dynamic organisation and regularly change/update/remove entries within its library of standards, this includes the ISO3166. It is rare for additions/changes/deletions for the ISO3166-1 but they do occur 

e.g Somalia -> Federal Republic of Somalia (2013), Creation of South Sudan 2011, 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1

ISO costs money, Wiki is free and seems very up to date 
API
---
> In Development
An API is available that can be used to extract any applicable updates for a country via URL. The API is in alpha stage so is just available via a Google Function at URL: 

> https://

The API documentation and usage with all useful commands and inputs to the API is available on the [README]() of the iso3166-updates-api folder. The API was built using GCP utilsing a Cloud Function backed by an API Gateway that can be called via a http trigger at the above url, the Function calls GCP Storage to access the back-end JSON with all ISO3166 updates. This JSON is updated regularly using a CRON job that is called every X months.

cd iso3166_updates
python3 setup.py install
```

Usage 
-----

```python
import iso3166_updates as iso3166_updates

#get all listed changes/updates for Andorra from wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:AD)
iso3166_updates.get_updates("AD")

#get all listed changes/updates for BA, DE, FR, HU, PY
iso3166_updates.get_updates(["BA","DE","FR","HU","PY"])

#get any listed changes/updates for HU, IT, JA, KE from wiki, in the year 2018
iso3166_updates.get_updates("HU, IT, JA, KE", year="2018")

#get any listed changes/updates for Ireland from wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:IE),
#between years of 2012 and 2021
iso3166_updates.get_updates("IE", year="2012-2021")

#get any listed changes/updates for Tanzania from wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:TZ),
#with updates years > 2015 
iso3166_updates.get_updates("TA", year=">2015")

#get any listed changes/updates for Yemen from wiki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:YE),

iso3166_updates.get_updates("YE", year=">2010")
```

The output to the above functions for the updates/changes to a ISO3166-2 country returns 4 columns: 
Edition/Newsletter, Date Issued, Description of change in newsletter and Code/Subdivision change. 
E.g the output csv format for AD (Andorra) is:

| Edition/Newsletter | Date Issued | Description of change in newsletter | Code/Subdivision change |   
|:-------------------|:------------|------------------------------------:|------------------------:|
| Newsletter I-8     | 2007-04-17  | Addition of the administrative subdivisions...   | Subdivisions added: 7 parishes...                 | 
| Online Browsing Platform (OBP) | 2014-11-03 | Update List Source | No subdivision changes listed |
| Online Browsing Platform (OBP) | 2015-11-27 | Update List Source | No subdivision changes listed |
