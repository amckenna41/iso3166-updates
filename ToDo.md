- [X] Unit tests for testing above filename convention.

- [X] If  no updates found for singular country export, export {} rather than "ES" : {}

- [X] Add license section to iso3166-updates docs main page.
- [X] Raise custom error if trying to access alpha code that exists but isnt in object after custom parameter input to class 
- [ ] Add more detail to examples in api.rst
- [ ] Add backtotop button for docs.
- [X] If Code/Subdivision change == "" then switch data in Description of change in newsletter to Code/Subdivison change attribute. 
- [X] Implement alpha-3 and numeric support for get_all script.
- [X] Change "Description of change in newsletter" -> "Description of change"
- [X] Go over get_all script.
- [X] python get_all_iso3166_updates.py --alpha=AD,AD - output file shouldn't be iso3166-updates-AD,AD.json - remove duplicate code.
- [X] Introduce parameter typing into software and scripts.
- [X] Double check spelling using code-spell-checker extension
- [X] Update check-for-updates script with get_all script.
- [X] In scripts, raise error if invalid year rather than skipping.
- [ ] In check-for-updates, programmatically get date that object was last updated in repo.
- [ ] Keep export functionality on check-for-updates. Set to true if wanting to export to bucket. Env vars not explicitly required, set create_issue=0 by default.
- [X] For year range function, if lesser number is on right or left of '-', it should still return the year range updates.
- [X] Update medium article with new endpoint updates etc.
- [ ] Add bucket details back to check-for-updates for export functionality.
- [X] Include return type for parameter typed functions.
- [X] Add months functionality to software?
- [X] In months functionality, add support for month range e.g /months/12-36, updates published over the past 12-36 months.
- [ ] In software, months function can accept int or str.
- [ ] Use github API to programtically print out when the object was last updated on the repo: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50194241/get-when-the-file-was-last-updated-from-a-github-repository. Mention in readme.
- [ ] In build_test workflow, split up build, test, linting into seperate sections. But need to install the required dependancies on each job as they are seperate and run on different machines. Combine build and test into one workflow?
- [ ] Double check artifacts are being exported in workflow file.
- [ ] Mention number of existing updates.
- [X] Reword sections in api.rst and usage.rst.
- [X] Split up years sections in usage.rst.
- [ ] Switch string formatting to f string.
- [ ] In check-for-updates, export_to_bucket and create_github_issue functions should return 1 or 0, and then this return value should be used to print out 
the adaquate success/failure message. Script shouldn't fail if either of the funcs fail?

Future addtions 
- [ ] Programmatically push latest version of software and object to PyPI - can do this in specific workflow.
