- [X] Update api to reflect updates from frontend.
- [X] API unit tests, pass in invalid 3 letter alpha-3 code, should return error message.
- [X] Remove request.args or request_json from api, probably only need one.
- [X] In check-for-updates, if new updates are found in month range, move old updates.json to an archive file with its date appened to filename, save new updates.json to root folder.

- [ ] Go through updates object country by country, comparing its output and that of wiki.
- [X] Include tests for year param in iso3166.get_updates(year=[])
- [X] If no alpha2 input param values input but year is then append year to filename, append list of years if less than 10 years input e.g iso3166-updates-RU-2011,2022.json, iso3166-updates-RU-2011,2022.csv
- [X] Unit tests for testing above filename convention.
- [X] Seperate export_json and export_csv filename variables into one export_filename var.
- [X] Currently if year passed in as var, all alpha2 codes are added to JSON, remove any empty ones.
- [X] Concat updates in csv file as well, add primary key column of alpha2 iso3166-1 code, only add column if one or more alpha2 codes present.
- [X] Unit tests for testing new primary key column in csv export.
- [X] In readme include examples of calling the main script from terminal, export_csv and export_json called by --export_json/--no-export_json.

- [X] python3 iso3166_updates.py --alpha2=ES,IE,FR --export_csv --no-concat_updates (doesnt produce individual csv files).
- [X] python3 iso3166_updates.py --alpha2=ES,IE,FR --no-concat_updates --year=2011 --export_csv : doesn't append year to filename.
- [X] Arrows in csv output (->) get converted into ,Üí - convert → to -> :
if unicodedata.name('→') == 'RIGHTWARDS ARROW' then convert to ->

- [X] Unit tests for CSV that has all updates from it.
- [X] If no updates found, export empty json but don't export empty csv, even if export_csv=True
- [X] python3 iso3166_updates.py --alpha2=ES,IE,FR --no-concat_updates --year=2011 --export_csv : exports empty CSVs. /iso3166_updates/test-iso3166-updates/iso3166-updates-ES-2011.csv 
- [X] If  no updates found for singular country export, export {} rather than "ES" : {} 
- [X] Include unit tests for json, open each json, validate keys and length.
- [X] Validate API returns {} when single alpha-2 input and no updates found e.g /alpha2/DE should return {} not "DE": {}.
- [X] Update iso3166-updates.json on repo and GCP with new updated functionality.

- [X] Get rid of export_json_filename and csv export_json_filename to just have one export_filename.
- [X] Add year range tests for test_alpha2 and test_alpha2_year test cases.

- [X] Add '.' to end of each json key.
- [ ] Note that for Date Issued column, corrected date is taken on not original for an update, if applicable.
- [X] Issue for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:TR update 2011-12-13, link to Newsletter is .pdff not .pdf, need to manually change this.
- [X] May need to use both data sources of wiki and ISO, ISO only contains "Short Description of change" column, wiki contains that + the "Code/Subdivision Change" and "Edition/Newsletter" columns which provides some extra info. 
- [ ] In demo, have selenium install script in a cell.
- [X] Mention in reamde that ISO website and wiki have seperate columns and data sometimes hence this project combines the 2 data sources.
- [X] Move selenium stuff to own script.
- [X] Fix bot detection on ISO website.
- [X] Change software approach, iso3166-updates package shouldn't pull all the updates data from the various sources each time, the software should just be used to access the upates json file. Move updates functionality to a get_updates.py script outside of pacakge. 
- [X] Randomise user-agent.
- [X] Might need to execute the script one by one for all countries. Make a bash script that executes the Python script with a random allocted pause in between each alpha-2.

- [ ] Ensure correct file are included/excluded from pypi package.
- [X] Change unit tests to test exported json file itself.

- [X] Json not concatenating properly
- [X] Add XK manually to JSON.
- [X] Some countries missing from JSON, e.g MZ - rerun shell script. MZ, PY, SK, VU, XK.
- [X] Might need to change up GCP Cloud arch to incorporate running selenium on cloud. Put check-for-updates func in Docker container. Test process using a simple app.
- [X] Update api.md file, need to add example of using /name path. Update readme about list of endpoints to include /name.
- [X] Add unit tests for name endpoint - can take from iso3166-2 unit tests for name.
- [ ] Create notebook for get_all script, easier to run and follow - download notebook and put in repo.
- [ ] Remove double spacing from string: import re, re.sub(' +', ' ', 'The     quick brown    fox').
- [X] Try recreating the driver on each iteration - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58968078/max-retries-exceeded-with-url-selenium.
- [X] Add use_selenium flag to just get wiki data not selenium, add to check-for-updates func.
- [X] Add get_driver() function from check-for-updates to main file on repo.
- [X] Mention check-for-updates microservice in readme.
